Random Creativity
=================

Is it possible to create truly creative, suprising procedural content? Or will the end result always be a predictable product of the list of the parameters of procedural heuristic? This project is a modest investigation of this question. 

The intention is to have some basic maze generation code in place and try to expand with variations around this concept. What happens if the shape of the maze gets varied? The colors? Does this result in  interesting mazes or more just more randomizations without soul?
